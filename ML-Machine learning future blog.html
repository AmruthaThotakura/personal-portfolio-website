            <h3>ML</h3>
            <p>Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that involves training algorithms to learn
                from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed
                is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical
                algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without
                explicit instructions,Advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks to surpass
                many previous approaches in performance.
                ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech
                recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine.The application of ML to business problems is
                known as predictive analytics.

            <h4>History of ML</h4>
            <p>The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field
                of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this
                time period.

                Although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a
                program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of machine learning
                roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. In 1949, Canadian
                psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a
                theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells. Hebb's model of neurons
                interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under
                nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. Other researchers who have studied
                human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including
                logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural
                networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.

                By the early 1960s, an experimental "learning machine" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had
                been developed by Raytheon Company to analyze sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns
                using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively "trained" by a human operator/teacher to
                recognize patterns and equipped with a "goof" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions.A
                representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning
                Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. Interest related to pattern
                recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. In 1981 a report was given
                on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26
                letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.</p>

            <h5>Importance of ML</h5>
            <p>Automation: ML enables automation of repetitive and mundane tasks, freeing up human resources for more
                strategic and creative work.
                Efficiency: ML improves efficiency by analyzing large datasets, identifying patterns, and making
                predictions or decisions.
                Innovation: ML drives innovation by enabling the development of new products and services, such as
                virtual assistants, self-driving cars, and personalized medicine.

            <p>Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to
                learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the "signal" or "feedback" available to the learning
                system:

                Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a
                "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.<br><br>
                Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find
                structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in
                data) or a means towards an end (feature learning)<br><br>
                Reinforcement learning: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform
                a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its
                problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize
